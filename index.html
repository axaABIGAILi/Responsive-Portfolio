            Hello! 
        </p>

        <p>
            My name is Abigail DeJesus - you can call me Abi for short. I am a student at the UTA Spring 2019 Coding Bootcamp and a graduate of The Ohio State University.
            Ii took up coding because I like the flexibility in job opportunities and mobility provided. I also like the work - it's like working at a puzzle, putting the pieces together.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My hobbies are gaming, coding, and listening to music. My favorite movie is Repo! The Genetic Opera, and my favorite food is fried chicken. I'm a total sucker for coffee, too!
        </p>

        <p>
            My goals for this bootcamp is to become a confident coder, create an awesome portfolio, and become employer competitive.
        </p>
